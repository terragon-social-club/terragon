  <p>Dear Concerned American,</p>
  <p>We&rsquo;re building a place for <u>Americans</u> to <u>share content</u>, <u>discuss ideas</u>, and <u>have fun</u>. Terragon is built by the best software engineers using the best technology and is funded by its members.</p>
  <p>The anti-American, globalist overlords in Silicon Valley currently have a firm grip on the conversations we have online. They&rsquo;re burying productive, fact driven, and funny content coming from average Americans and actively promoting anti-American, pro-Communist and divisive content originating from bad actors across the globe. And they&rsquo;ll never be held to account, because they only answer to their investors and advertising partners. They do not serve their users and never will.</p>
  <p>Terragon is different. Terragon is being built out in the open as we speak, using funding from its founding members. We&rsquo;re utilizing open source, American technology to ensure that our platform is even more powerful, flexible and reliable than anything that the enemies of the American People could ever dream of creating.</p>
  <p>Our platform is taking shape daily thanks to our continuous deployment pipeline. We&rsquo;re moving fast, but we need your help to keep going. You can support us and become a founding member today!</p>
  <p>Sincerely Yours,</p>
